# Haku TODOs

- Support から and に and maybe まで wherever と is OK
- Variables should probably be renamed because we'd like kanji-based variables as well as katakana
- Every expression should optionally be preceded by a comment
- Adjectives as distinct parts of nouns, probably only -i and -na, plus maybe -kute, -de
- Adjectival verbs as function application
- Treatment of の which should bind tighter than と, specifically for Noun-based function application
- Errors should work on programs with newlines, we should say "on line $line_nr"
